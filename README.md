# PaCS-MD script for HPC

This is the optimized script for running PaCS-MD on HPC.
The script help to distribute the simulations in the most effective ways on multiple nodes.
This script currently can work with AMBER, GENESIS, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD, OpenMM

# Prerequisites
* A working simulation packages: AMBER, GENESIS, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD, OpenMM
* Standard python library.
* Numpy, Numba, multiprocessing, pyMPI.
